The current position in the document is within the Introduction section. This section should start broadly and narrow to the specific research question, providing necessary context through relevant literature. It should clearly state the study's purpose, justify its importance, use present tense for established facts and research aims, cite key sources, avoid methodological details, and maintain an objective tone throughout.
