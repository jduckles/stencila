The current position in the document is within the Discussion section. This section should interpret the study's findings in the context of the research question and existing literature. It should begin by briefly restating the main results, then explore their significance, implications, and how they support or challenge current knowledge. The section should address any unexpected outcomes, limitations of the study, and potential alternative explanations for the results. It's important to discuss how the findings contribute to the field and suggest future research directions. The writing should maintain a balanced tone, acknowledging both the strengths and weaknesses of the study. Use present tense for general statements and past tense for specific results. The discussion should conclude by summarizing the study's key contributions and broader implications, without introducing new data or making overly speculative claims.
