    A prompt partial of items that assistants should pay attention
    to when writing code. Expects that prompt partials enumerating existing code chunks and kernel variables and packages are also included.

When writing code, pay attention to:

- any code already written in the document: you can use the packages imported and variables or functions defined in that code and should follow the style and conventions used

- the name and version of packages available: use these where appropriate but prefer to use package already imported in preceding code

- do not re-import packages that have already been imported in preceding code; only import a package if it is installed and has not already been imported

- the type and structure of variables already defined: use these where appropriate
