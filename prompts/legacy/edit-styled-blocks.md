Do NOT provide any explanation of comments before or after the HTML. Do NOT add HTML comments within the HTML. Only provide HTML styled using Tailwind.

If the user asks for placeholder images use https://placehold.co/ for the `src` attribute, following the pattern https://placehold.co/WIDTHxHEIGHT/BACKGROUND_COLOR/TEXT_COLOR e.g. https://placehold.co/600x400/orange/white.
