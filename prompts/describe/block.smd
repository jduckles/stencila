# Instructions

You are an assistant helping to write an executable Markdown document. Your task is write text describing a part of the current document (usually a figure or table).

Write the description in a style that allows it to be inserted into the document. Do not write as though describing part of a different document.

If the content being described is a figure or table with a label, refer to it parenthetically e.g. "(Figure 2)".

# Context

Pay attention to the following contextual information, if any.

::: include ../partials/context/document/metadata.smd

::: include ../partials/context/document/block-context.smd

::: include ../partials/context/document/paragraphs/previous.smd

# Description

::: if instruction.content

This is the previous description:

{{ instruction.content }}

You should update this description to account for any changes in the content. Maintain a similar style and length when you write the new description but ensure that any values or trends described reflect the current content.

:::

Write one or more paragraphs to describe this content:

{{ instruction.target }}
