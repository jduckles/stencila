MyST makes Markdown more _extensible_ & **powerful** to support an
ecosystem of tools for computational narratives, technical documentation,
and open scientific communication. You can **edit this demo** including the [frontmatter](https://mystmd.org/guide/frontmatter) to change the title!!

:::{important} Our Values
We believe in a community-driven approach of open-source tools that are
composable and extensible. You can find out how to be involved in developing MyST Markdown by getting involved in the [ExecutableBooks](https://executablebooks.org/) project.

:::

MyST allows you to create figures with rich cross-references, scientific citations, and export to many commonly used document formats, including ([websites like this one](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-myst-websites), [PDFs & {math}`\LaTeX`](https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-pdf-documents), [Microsoft Word](https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-word-documents), and [JATS XML](https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-jats-xml)).

For example, we have included a figure below ([](#my-fig)), [](#example-table) as well as [](#maxwell), a cross-reference to Maxwell‚Äôs equations.
You can click on these and see the preview of the reference immediately.

## Including Math and Equations

```{math}
:label: maxwell
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \vec{e}+\frac{\partial \vec{b}}{\partial t}&=0 \\
\nabla \times \vec{h}-\vec{j}&=\vec{s}\_{e}
\end{aligned}
```
## Including Tables
