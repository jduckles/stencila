The text for each step supports a limited subset of Markdown including __emphasis__, **bold**, and ``code`` (note specific syntax). Also don't forget emoji ðŸ¦„!

Use the special ``type`` link to insert a source fragment at the end of ``empty.smd``. Links on their own line are rendered as a button. e.g.

- Let's type a [heading](type:0)

- Create an [instruction](type:1)

[Write a code chunk](type:2)
