title: Using LLMs to edit diagrams
---

• In addition to helping create Mermaid diagrams, LLMs can be useful for editing and refining them.

• Lets say that you have written a diagram photosynthsis but want to change the color of some blocks.

• [Insert](type:0) an ``edit`` instruction immediately before the diagram and ending with a ``>`` character (to indicate that you want to edit the following block only). Press $(play) to run the instruction.
