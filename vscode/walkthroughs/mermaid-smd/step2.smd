title: Using LLMs to create diagrams
---

• Stencila has several built-in prompts specialized for creating certain types of Mermaid diagrams.

• For example, the ``stencila/create/figure-flowchart`` prompt is specialized to create flowchards. It makes use of the document context, including metadata and the preceding paragraph. This means you don't need to repeat youself when writing instructions.

• To illustrate this, let's [add](type:0) a paragraph, followed by an instruction to create a new flowchart. Press the $(run) icon to execute the instruction using a LLM.

• Note that as well as generating the Mermaid code, this prompt wraps it in a figure and add a caption that is based on the document context.

• If you don't like the suggested provided by the LLM, you can add feedback after the ``suggest`` keyword and press the $(refresh) icon (or do the same in the preview window).
