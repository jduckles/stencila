---

• Stencila Markdown also supports writing math using AsciiMath, a simpler syntax than TeX.

• Add display AsciiMath equations as a code block with `asciimath` as the language [like this](type:0).

• You can also add inline AsciiMath within paragraphs [like this](type:1).

***

The circumference of a circle is,

```asciimath
C = 2pi r
```

***

where `r`{asciimath} is the radius of the circle.
