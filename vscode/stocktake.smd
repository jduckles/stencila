# VSCode theme

Word wrapping should be the default for Markdown

# Document preview

The default theme is not being applied. `default.css` seems to being loaded and `[root]` is set so not sure what is goin on here.

# Inlines

## Marks

The marks like _emphasis_, **bold**, super^script^ and sub~script~, and ~~strikethrough~~ are all being parsed properly but the DOM HTML codec in Rust is just encoding content as <stencila-text> when it should encode as <em>, <strong> etc (with text inside it).

## Inline code

As for codec expressions, the backgound is not necesaary, and overall having a node card pop up feels over the top especially when it has no language (and thus no need for syntax highlighting i.e. should be treated as a mark, may add `VerbatimInline` type for this?).

## Code expressions

Code expressions (inline executable code) is displying the code, they should display the output: `3*4`{js exec}.

I don't think the backround colouring is neccessary given that there are chips.

## Inline math

Really quite broken (see below for math blocks): $2 pi r^2$

## Inline instructions

Syntax is finicky (no space between `[[` and `do`)

Instructions work but `suggestion` property are not being updated to Markdown or rendered by Web Components (although they are in HTML):  [[do @insert-code-expression three times two]].

Make Jinja undefined handling leniant

# Blocks

## General

Something

## Headings

The node chip for headings should show H1, H2 etc. As a user I want to hover over the heading a see what level it is.

## Code chunks

```js exec
6 * 7
```

## Math blocks

The MathML of the document not getting generated and displayed even when the whole document is run.

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Block instructions

As with inline instructions, the authorship and provenance are not being rendered in the Web Components.

When I go in and remove "wrapper-css="hidden" attribute on the <stencila-ui-node-collapsible-property> for the authors they show up (albeit not completely styled properly). I wonder if this may be related to VSCode/Electron using an oldish version of Chrome and if setting the browslist option when bundling with Parcel could fix this.
