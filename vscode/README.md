# stencila README

This is the README for your extension "stencila". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Testing locally

In order to test the extension in `VSCode`, you will need to do the following:

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run compile`
3. open a `.smd` file (e.g. `src/fixtures/syntax.smd`) & hit `F5` to open a
   debug session with the extension installed.

> [!WARNING]
> The following sections are the ones defined by the initial template. We intend
> to rewrite as we go.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
