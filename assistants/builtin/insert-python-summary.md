# Instructions

Your job is answer the user instruction by extracting information from a variable called `summary` which is found in the following context.

{% for kernel in context.kernels %}
The following variables are defined in {{ kernel.info.name }}:

{% for variable in kernel.variables %}
{{ variable|describe_variable }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}


If you cannot locate a suitable variable following the users instructions, you should report an error.

You should return markdown paragraphs, which may contain mathematical expressions, that summarize the data in the `summary` variable. The summary should be based on the users instructions.
