# Introduction

This walkthrough illustrates the various ways that you include math equations and symbols in documents, including using TeX, AsciiMath and LLMs.

...

# Using TeX to write math

Stencila supports TeX equations both in display mode (math blocks), and inline, within paragraphs e.g.

The area of a circle with radius $r$ is,

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

> [!tip] Previewing rendered math
> Use the `View` action above math blocks to preview them rendered within the document.

...

# Using AsciiMath to write math

Stencila also supports [AsciiMath](https://asciimath.org/), an easy-to-write markup language for math e.g.

The area of a circle with radius `r`{asciimath} is,

```asciimath
A = pi r^2
```

...

# Using MathML to write math

If you want full control over the rendered match you can also use [MathML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML) e.g.

The area of a circle with radius `<math><mi>r</mi></math>`{mathml} is,

```mathml
<math display="block">
  <mi>A</mi>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mi>&pi;</mi>
  <msup>
    <mi>r</mi>
    <mn>2</mn>
  </msup>
</math>
```

...

# Using LLMs to write math

The builtin `stencila/create/math-block` prompt is specialized to write display math blocks (defaulting to using TeX unless you specify AsciiMath or MathML).

The prompt makes use of the document context, including the preceding paragraph, and the math symbols used previously. This means you don't need to repeat yourself when writing commands.

Let's try this out by writing a paragraph introducing the equation we want, followed by a `create` command specifying the `math-block` prompt.

...

The probability density function for the normal distribution is,

::: create @math-block  <<

> [!tip] Run the command
> Use the `Run` action to get an available LLM to generate an equation based on the preceding paragraph. Use the `Revise` action, optionally with feedback, if you are not satisfied with the response. You can also edit the generated equation, and once you are happy with it, use the `Accept` action to archive the command and insert the equation into the main body of the document.

...

The `math-block` prompt will match to command instructions that include words such as 'equation' and 'formula' so, if you prefer, you can avoid specifically assigning it to a task e.g.

::: create equation for pearson corr coefficient <<

...

# Using LLMs to fix math

You can also use LLMs to fix existing math equations. The generic, builtin `stencila/fix/block` prompt will pass any syntax error messages in TeX or AsciiMath equations to help inform LLMs what needs to be fixed e.g.

::: fix  >>

$$
A = \pie r^^2
$$

> [!tip] Run the command
> Use the `Run` action to get an available LLM to suggest a fix to the code. If the fix is correct, and there are no more errors, you can use the `Accept` action to apply the fix and archive the command.
