# Stencila Demo Workspace

Welcome the main Stencila demo workspace ðŸŽ‰!

This workspace has some common Python and R packages installed via a `devbox.json` file including `matplotlib`, `pandas`
and `tidyverse` (includes `ggplot2` and `dplyr`).

If you are opening this workspace on Stencila Cloud (or have set up an API token) you'll also have access to the Stencila Model Router to run AI instructions to make use of those packages e.g.

::: new run R violin plot of diamond price versus cut with colors
