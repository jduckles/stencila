An exiting math block:

$$
d = 2r
$$

An insert math block instruction that has been accepted:

// @insert-math-block the area of a circle

++ accepted

$$
a = \pi r^2
$$

++

An insert math block instruction that has been rejected:

// @insert-math-block the diameter of a circle

++ rejected

$$
d = foo
$$

++

An insert math block instruction that has not yet been accepted or rejected:

// @insert-math-block the circumference of a circle

++

$$
c = 2\pi r
$$
