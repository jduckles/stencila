In some cases, internal temporal rhythms are used to spatially organize a body plan. For example, in vertebrate embryos a molecular ‘segmentation clock’ acts at regular intervals to divide the developing body axis into discrete blocks of cells that later differentiate into individual somites (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115>). In plants, the regular spacing of lateral roots along the length of the primary root axis is controlled by a ‘root clock’ that generates a temporally oscillating developmental signal (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111116>). Thus in both plants and animals, internal body clocks can generate serially-repeated organs. These types of clocks are distinct from the circadian oscillator, the biological clock found in most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111117>). Circadian clocks coordinate development on daily and seasonal time scales. In both plants and animals, the circadian clock can integrate environmental cues such as day length and temperature to time the transition to reproductive stages to the appropriate season (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111118>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111119>). On a diel scale, the circadian clock can coordinate developmental processes with environmental transitions associated with the earth’s rotation, such as leaf movement in plants, eclosion in </stencila-text><stencila-emphasis id=emp_1111111B><stencila-text id=txt_1111111A>Drosophila</stencila-text></stencila-emphasis><stencila-text id=txt_1111111C>, and conidiation in </stencila-text><stencila-emphasis id=emp_1111111E><stencila-text id=txt_1111111D>Neurospora</stencila-text></stencila-emphasis><stencila-text id=txt_1111111F> (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111G>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111H>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111J>).

Circadian rhythms, biological processes regulated by the circadian clock, meet several fundamental criteria (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111M>). First, they are stably entrained to environmental cues. Second, they persist in free running environmental conditions. Third, circadian rhythms are temperature compensated such that they maintain a uniform period over a range of ambient temperatures, in contrast to the general rule that the rate of enzymatic processes changes with temperature. In addition, the circadian clock gates certain biological processes so that responsiveness to environmental cues is time-of-day dependent. For example, studies in humans show the timing of drug treatment can be critical to creating an effective therapeutic response (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111N>). A functioning circadian clock whose biological rhythms match that of the environment provides a fitness advantage for many organisms, including plants (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111P>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111Q>), animals (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111R>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111S>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111T>), bacteria (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111U>), and fungi (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111V>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_1111111e><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111111X>One important way the circadian clock promotes fitness is by controlling timing of reproductive development, for example by allowing organisms to distinguish between the long and short days of different seasons. In plants, the circadian system mediates the effects of day length during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, usually referred to as flowering time (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111Y>). The circadian clock also regulates daily aspects of floral development, for example coordinating daily rhythms in scent emission and floral opening and closing with pollinator activity (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111Z>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111a>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111b>). In addition, the circadian clock is implicated in the uniform eastward orientation observed in mature sunflower plants; this eastward orientation was shown to enhance both male and female reproductive fitness (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111c>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111d>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_1111111v><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111111f>Domesticated sunflower is an excellent model system to study the temporal regulation of floral development. Sunflowers are members of the Asteraceae, a highly successful family comprised of about 30,000 distinct species that are widely dispersed around the world (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111g>). Asteraceae are characterized by the arrangement of individual florets together in a complex, compressed inflorescence called the capitulum. Individual florets are arranged on the capitulum disk in spiral patterns, a classic type of phyllotaxis observed in many plants (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111h>). These phyllotactic spirals, called parastichies, are generated by the precise specification of floral primordia, first at the outer rim and then moving into the center of the capitulum disk (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111i>). In domesticated sunflower, specification of the hundreds or even thousands of floret primordia found on a single capitulum takes approximately 10-14 days (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111j>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111k>), followed approximately 20 days later by the onset of anthesis, or floral opening, of the first florets (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111m>). Anthesis of all florets on a capitulum head typically occurs over 5-10 days (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111n>). Intriguingly, the timing of anthesis does not follow the gradual and continuous pattern of development seen during specification of floret primordia on the developing capitulum (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111o>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111p>). Instead, discrete developmental boundaries are observed with obvious rings of florets at distinct stages of anthesis (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111q>). Each ring, or pseudowhorl, undergoes anthesis on successive days. While previous studies examined the effects of hormones and environmental factors on the timing of development of florets within a pseudowhorl (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111r>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111s>), the mechanisms governing the conversion of the continuous spiral pattern of development seen early in floral development (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111t>) to the ringlike patterns seen during anthesis (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111111u>) have not been explored.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_1111111x><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111111w>Here, we investigate the timing of floral organ development in various environmental conditions. We find that temperature-compensated daily rhythms in development of both male and female floral organs, and the formation of pseudowhorls, persist when flowers are maintained in constant environmental conditions in the absence of light. However, both daily rhythms in development and the formation of pseudowhorls are lost in constant light, with late-stage floret maturation occurring continuously along parastichies. Importantly, the effects of light on floret development are time-of-day-dependent. Together, these data indicate that late-stage floret development is regulated by the circadian clock. We propose that pseudowhorls are produced in response to an external coincidence mechanism, in which developmentally competent florets undergo reproductive transitions only when they receive environmental cues at the appropriate time of day. Our data thus suggest a role for the circadian clock in the spatial as well as temporal control of sunflower development.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph></section></stencila-section><stencila-section id=sec_11111114W><section slot=content><stencila-heading id=hea_111111121><h1 slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111111z>Results</stencila-text></h1><div slot=authors></div></stencila-heading><stencila-section id=sec_11111112U><section slot=content><stencila-heading id=hea_111111123><h2 slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_111111122>During anthesis the pattern of development changes from continuous to discrete</stencila-text></h2><div slot=authors></div></stencila-heading><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111112C><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_111111124>The phyllotactic spirals of florets, or parastichies, on sunflower capitula represent continuous age-gradients with the first-specified florets on the outside edge of the capitulum (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111125>) (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111126>). Each disc floret is an individual flower with an epigynous ovary that holds a corolla tube of fused petals (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111127>). Within the corolla tube is the fused anther tube, subtended by five filaments, collectively forming the stamen (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111128>). Finally, at the center of the floret is the style and stigma (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111129>), which we will together call the style. Although early floret development occurs continuously across the capitulum, anthesis does not. Local synchronization of floret development at this developmental stage converts the obvious spiral arrangement of florets on immature capitula into a ring-like pattern of pseudowhorls (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112A> vs </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112B>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111112T><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111112D>Previous studies described daily patterns in sunflower floret anthesis, with a single floret releasing pollen the day before the stigma of this floret is receptive to pollen (Putt, 1940; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112E>). Before anthesis all reproductive organs are enclosed within the corolla tube (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112F>). As anthesis begins, the corolla tubes of multiple florets within a pseudowhorl coordinately rise above the capitulum surface (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112G>) driven by ovary growth rather than expansion of the corolla (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112H>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112J>). Next, rapid elongation of anther filaments causes anther tube protrusion above the corolla (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112K>) (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112L>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112M>). In this staminate stage of anthesis, pollen is released within the anther tube and is then pushed up and out by the rapid growth of the style through the anther tube soon after dawn (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112N>). Continued style elongation pushes the stigma beyond the anther tube to initiate the pistillate stage of anthesis (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112P>). This plunger-style mechanism of pollen presentation is an ancestral feature of the Asteraceae family (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112Q>). The stigmas then unfold and become receptive to pollen the day after pollen release (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112R>). The temporal and spatial separation between pollen release and stigma presentation in sunflowers promotes cross-fertilization across head (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112S>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph></section></stencila-section><stencila-section id=sec_111111134><section slot=content><stencila-heading id=hea_11111112W><h2 slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111112V>Pseudowhorls are generated by synchronized, daily rhythms in floret development</stencila-text></h2><div slot=authors></div></stencila-heading><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111112f><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111112X>To better understand the synchronization of anthesis within each pseudowhorl, we characterized the detailed temporal dynamics of late-stage floret development. Plants were maintained in light-dark cycles and constant temperature. Florets within a single pseudowhorl were dissected every 15 – 30 minutes over 24 hours and individual organ lengths measured. Ovary elongation was observed first, starting near the time of lights off and continuing for approximately 10 hours (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112Y>). As previously described (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112Z>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112a>), we found that stamen elongation commenced approximately 8 hours after lights off, driven by an approximately 2.5x increase in anther filament length over 5 hours (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112b>). Anther tubes, like corolla tubes, did not elongate during this time frame. Stamens reached maximal length at time 28, and later shrank due to filament collapse (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112c>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112d>). Styles initiated rapid elongation one hour after anther filaments, with growth continuing over 11 hours until they reached ∼2x their original length and grew past the stamens. Thus, the obvious discrete phases of anthesis visible on whole capitula (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112e>) are driven primarily by the consecutive and highly coordinated elongation of ovaries, anther filaments, and styles within each pseudowhorl.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111112r><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111112g>We next investigated the effects of different environmental conditions on the dynamics of floret development. We used time-lapse movies of sunflowers undergoing anthesis taken at 15-minute intervals and scored observable patterns of growth as proxies for the detailed organ measurements described above. We first examined growth kinetics in capitula undergoing anthesis in long-day conditions reminiscent of a summer day (16 hours light, 8 hours dark, and constant 25°C (LD|25°C (16h:8h)). A new pseudowhorl of florets underwent anthesis every 24 hours, with ovary swelling initiating in the late night, stamen elongation visible from late night to soon after dawn, and conspicuous style elongation occurring in the latter part of the day and early night (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112h>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112i>; Video 1). Times of ovary, stamen, and style growth were highly coordinated across pseudowhorls and flowers (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112j>). The mean midpoint of visible ovary growth occurred before dawn at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 22.9 (with the time of lights on defined as ZT 0), followed by the mean midpoint of stamen growth at ZT 1.3, and the mean midpoint of style growth before dusk at ZT 12.6 (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112k>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112m>). Similar experiments were carried out for plants exposed to shorter (LD|25°C (12h:2h)) or longer (LD|25°C (19.5h:4.5h)) photoperiods. Similar daily rhythms of anthesis were observed in all three conditions, with the phases of organ growth relative to dawn changing only slightly with different night lengths (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112n>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112o>). In all three photoperiod conditions, the timing of floret development within pseudowhorls was highly coordinated (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112p>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112q>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_111111133><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111112s>This high degree of developmental coordination within each pseudowhorl is quite remarkable given that the initiation of floret primordia along a parastichy occurs continuously over many days (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112t>). We therefore examined the timing of ovary, stamen, and style growth within a pseudowhorl along separate parastichies (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112u>). While the number of florets per parastichy in a pseudowhorl varied, growth of the three different organs occurred at almost the identical time for all florets (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112v>). Ovary lengths were also measured along individual parastichies at ZT 2, a time when ovary growth within a pseudowhorl is complete (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112w>). The lengths of ovaries within a pseudowhorl along a parastichy were similar to each other (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112x>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112y>), but there was a large step-down in length compared to ovaries of pre-anthesis florets in the same parastichy. Previous studies showed the large changes in ovary size and filament length during anthesis are due to rapid cell expansion (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111112z>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111131>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111132>). The remarkable synchronization of cell elongation and organ growth during anthesis, despite the age difference of florets along each parastichy, suggests some master regulator coordinates anthesis within each pseudowhorl.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph></section></stencila-section><stencila-section id=sec_11111113R><section slot=content><stencila-heading id=hea_111111136><h2 slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_111111135>Daily rhythms in floret development persist in constant dark conditions and are temperature compensated</stencila-text></h2><div slot=authors></div></stencila-heading><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111113C><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_111111137>The precise daily timing of sunflower anthesis suggested the circadian clock might be involved in this process. To test this, we examined the development of sunflower capitula maintained in constant dark and temperature. Rhythms in ovary and stamen elongation persisted in these free-running conditions, with a new pseudowhorl of florets undergoing anthesis every ∼24 hours with phases similar to those seen in light&#x2F;dark cycles (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111138>; Video 2). Scoring of individual florets along a parastichy confirmed coordinated floret organ growth within a pseudowhorl (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111139>), even after 4 days in DD|25°C (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113A>). We next examined ovary lengths among the florets along individual parastichies. As in photoperiodic conditions, ovary lengths between pseudowhorls were clearly distinct (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113B>). Thus, daily rhythms in anthesis and the formation of pseudowhorls persisted in the absence of environmental cues, suggesting regulation by the circadian clock.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111113J><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111113D>As seen for ovaries and stamens, the start of visible style elongation within each pseudowhorl occurred at the expected times and was highly coordinated for the first two days in constant darkness (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113E>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113F>). However, style elongation rates were very slow in DD|25°C (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113G>) such that style growth in one pseudowhorl continued even after florets in the subsequent pseudowhorl began anthesis. This resulted in almost continuous style elongation across the capitulum. The immediate slowing of style but not ovary or stamen elongation upon transfer to constant darkness (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113H>) suggests that different regulatory pathways control growth of these organs. However, the rhythmic initiation of growth of all three types of organs in constant darkness suggests a general role for the circadian clock in the control of anthesis.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111113Q><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111113K>Circadian-regulated processes are characterized by their relative insensitivity to temperature variation across a physiologically relevant range (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113L>).

When the onset of darkness occurred during the subjective night, anthesis proceeded in the expected pattern with minor phase adjustments (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113X>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113Y>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113Z>). However, when the onset of darkness occurred during the subjective day, different effects were observed for ovaries compared to stamens and styles. In pseudowhorl 2, the first pseudowhorl undergoing development in the new light conditions, ovary elongation began at the expected time but with a slow growth rate that continued until the next period of darkness (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113a>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113b>). In contrast, development of stamens and styles did not initiate until ovary growth within pseudowhorl 2 was complete. As a result, dark treatment during the subjective day caused a considerable lag in anthesis (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113c>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113d>). After two days in each new photoperiodic condition, the phases of ovary, stamen, and style elongation shifted such that maturation of all floret organs occurred with stable phase relationships to the new times of dusk and dawn (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113e>). This rapid shift in the phase of anthesis suggests re-entrainment of the circadian clock may occur quickly in sunflower capitula.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111113p><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111113g>We further characterized anthesis in the ZT 14-18.5 condition, in which darkness occurred two hours earlier than in the original entraining conditions. In this condition, there was a 42.9-hour difference between start of pseudowhorl 2 ovary growth and the start of pseudowhorl 3 ovary growth, compared to the 22.8-hour difference seen in the ZT 16-20.5 dark condition (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113h>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113i>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113j>). Surprisingly, this large delay in anthesis did not cause two pseudowhorls to develop simultaneously: the average number of new florets undergoing anthesis within the new pseudowhorl stayed the same across the different light treatments (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113k>).

In contrast, dark treatment from ZT 16 – 20.5 promoted the highly coordinated pattern of anthesis seen in LD|25°C (16h:8h) conditions (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113n>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113o>). The large difference in maturation patterns depending upon whether lights were turned off at ZT 14 or at ZT 16 demonstrates a time-of-day dependent response to dark cues, a further indication of circadian clock regulation of this process.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111113u><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111113q>Many circadian-regulated processes exhibit frequency demultiplication; that is, they maintain 24-hour rhythms even when subjected to light&#x2F;dark cycles with a cycle length close to half that of the endogenous period (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113r>). We therefore examined whether multiple periods of darkness during a 24-hour period would affect the timing of floret anthesis within pseudowhorls.

One pseudowhorl of florets underwent anthesis every 24 hours, but florets within each pseudowhorl were poorly coordinated (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113s>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111113t>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_111111142><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111113v>We next changed the proportion of darkness in a 24-hour period to a 6-hour period of darkness during the subjective day followed by an 8-hour period of darkness during the subjective night (LDLD|25°C (6h:6h:4h:8h).

To investigate whether constant light also affected other aspects of flower development, we entrained sunflowers in LD|25°C (16h:8h) and then transitioned them to constant light and temperature (LL|25°C) on the first day of anthesis. As expected, no stamen growth was observed (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111149>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114A>; Video 3). Ovaries and styles did elongate, but initiation occurred continuously across the capitulum. Instead of the coordinated floret anthesis seen along a parastichy of florets in LD|25°C (16h:8h) (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114B>), in LL|25°C florets showed a continuous, age-dependent pattern of anthesis (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114C>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114D>; Video 3).

Thus, in constant light conditions the timing of anthesis mirrors the continuous pattern of floret specification seen very early in capitulum development.

Here, we show that daily rhythms in the development of floral organs in sunflower persist in constant environmental conditions, are temperature compensated, and exhibit a time-of-day specific response to environmental cues (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114j>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114k>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114m>). We therefore conclude that the circadian clock controls floral development in sunflower to ensure release of pollen soon after dawn and the emergence of styles and stigmas late in the day. Although style elongation is largely complete near the end of the first day of floret anthesis (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114n>) (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114o>), stigmas do not become receptive to pollen until the following morning (Putt, 1940; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114p>). This temporal separation between release of pollen and stigma receptivity is thought to reduce self-pollination and is prevalent throughout the Asteraceae family (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114q>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_111111152><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111114s>We found that elongation of ovaries, anther filaments, and styles are all under circadian regulation, but respond differently to environmental cues. For example, transfer to constant light caused a complete inhibition of anther filament elongation, significantly slowed ovary expansion, but had no significant effect on style elongation (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114t>). In contrast, transfer to constant darkness slowed style elongation considerably but had only modest effects on growth of ovaries and anther filaments (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114u>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114v>). The strong inhibition of style elongation in constant darkness may help explain why rhythms in style emergence were less robust than those of ovary and anther growth in this condition (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114w>). Responses of the different organs to temperature were also distinct: temperature cycles slowed ovary expansion and had no effect on anther filament growth in either constant darkness or light; however, temperature cycles slowed style elongation rates in constant darkness but not constant light (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114x>). These results are consistent with our previous field studies that showed modest changes in ambient temperature affected style but not anther filament elongation (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114y>). Overall, the different sensitivities of floral organs to light and temperature suggest they may be regulated by distinct growth regulatory pathways. This is consistent with studies in other plants, which revealed that different hormones regulate the growth of male and female reproductive organs (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111114z>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111151>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111115A><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_111111153>While the molecular pathways controlling elongation of anther filaments and styles in sunflower are likely different, we demonstrate that their common regulation by the circadian clock results in the fast and near-synchronous release of pollen a few hours after dawn. Intriguingly, many bee- and butterfly-pollinated Asteraceae species release pollen in the morning (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111154>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111155>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111156>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111157>) while at least one bat-pollinated member of the family releases pollen in the early night (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111158>). Since the precise timing of pollen release relative to dawn affects male reproductive success in sunflower (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_111111159>), it is tempting to speculate that clock regulation of late-stage floret development may be widespread in the Asteraceae. Identification of the mechanisms by which the circadian system coordinates the growth of male and female floral organs to promote timely pollen release will be of great interest.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_11111115M><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111115B>The ecological and evolutionary success of the Asteraceae family, estimated to contain ∼10% of angiosperm species, is attributed in part to their compressed inflorescences that act together as single false flowers to attract pollinators (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115C>). In sunflowers, the individual disk floret primordia are first initiated on the outer perimeter of the very large, flat head meristem and subsequent primordia are initiated following a centripetal pattern to generate the characteristic spiral pattern of immature florets seen across the disk (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115D>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115E>) (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115F>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115G>). Recent experimental and modeling studies in gerbera daisies attributed formation of this spiral pattern to short-range interactions between spatially close initia (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115H>). In contrast, our work suggests that the ringlike pattern of pseudowhorls that emerges during anthesis (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115J>, </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115K>) is generated by the action of the circadian clock on florets across the capitulum disk, with loss of synchronized daily rhythms in anthesis in constant light and temperature leading to loss of pseudowhorl formation (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115L>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_1111115X><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_11111115N>How do florets of different developmental ages temporally coordinate anthesis to generate pseudowhorls? We propose that a type of external coincidence model is at work, analogous to the mechanisms underlying photoperiodic control of the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in many plants (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115P>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_11111115Q>). In our model, developmentally competent immature florets respond to a period of darkness that falls during the subjective night and is at least 4.5 hours long by undergoing the growth events that lead to anthesis (ovary expansion followed by the rapid onset of anther filament and then style elongation) (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115R>). This is conceptually similar to photoperiodic control of flowering in short day plants such as rice, in which light at night inactivates a clock-regulated transcription factor that promotes the transition to flowering (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115S>). However, we speculate that local signals also contribute to the coordination of floret anthesis across the capitulum disk. Imposition of dark treatments during the subjective day delayed anthesis by close to 24 hours (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115T>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115U>), until normal rhythmic patterns of anthesis resumed after entrainment to the new light conditions. However, pseudowhorls that developed subsequent to these delays contain the same number of florets as those found on plants that did not experience delays (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115V>). This suggests that signaling may occur between florets in adjacent pseudowhorls to control the onset of anthesis. This might be a positive cue from post-anthesis florets to promote development of the next pseudowhorl, or a negative cue from pre-anthesis florets to inhibit development of nearby florets (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115W>).</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_1111115h><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111115Y>Plants are generally considered diurnal organisms and often have more robust circadian rhythms in constant light than in constant darkness (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115Z>).

An interesting question for further study is whether in constant light sunflower floret rhythms are present but masked, or whether the floral circadian clock is arrhythmic in this condition. The very rapid resetting of the different phases of organ growth to new light conditions (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115g>) suggests the latter may be true.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_1111115n><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111115i>Another interesting question is why florets of different developmental ages undergo coordinated anthesis to generate pseudowhorls. It has been reported that the foraging activity of both honeybees and native bees on sunflower heads is positively correlated with the number of florets undergoing anthesis at any given time, and that seed set is strongly correlated with the number of bees foraging on heads (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115j>; </stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115k>). In the case of the highly social honeybees, hive members communicate via a dance language to quickly reallocate the numbers of foragers sent to different food sources based on resource availability (</stencila-text><stencila-text id=txt_1111115m>). We therefore speculate that the coordinated release of floral rewards by the hundreds of florets undergoing anthesis within a pseudowhorl each morning may be a mechanism to enhance attractiveness to pollinators and thus promote reproductive success.</stencila-text></p></stencila-paragraph></section></stencila-section><stencila-section id=sec_1111116n><section slot=content><stencila-heading id=hea_1111115q><h1 slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111115p>Materials and Methods</stencila-text></h1><div slot=authors></div></stencila-heading><stencila-section id=sec_1111116C><section slot=content><stencila-heading id=hea_1111115s><h2 slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111115r>Sunflower Floret Development Imaging and Scoring</stencila-text></h2><div slot=authors></div></stencila-heading><stencila-paragraph id=pgh_1111116B><p slot=content><stencila-text id=txt_1111115t>Sunflower seeds of HA412 HO (USDA ID: PI 603993) genotype were planted into small pots of soil (Sunshine Mix #1, Sun Gro Horticulture) and germinated with a plastic lid in a PGV36 growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) at 25°C with 16 hours light (provided by metal halide and incandescent lamps, 300 μmol m</stencila-text><stencila-superscript id=sup_1111115v><stencila-text id=txt_1111115u>-2</stencila-text></stencila-superscript><stencila-text id=txt_1111115w> s</stencila-text><stencila-superscript id=sup_1111115y><stencila-text id=txt_1111115x>-1</stencila-text></stencila-superscript><stencila-text id=txt_1111115z>) and 8 hours darkness per day.

Infrared LEDs (Mouser Electronics, El Cajon, CA, USA) were programmed to flash during image capture so that the capitula were visible in the dark without disrupting plant growth.
