# Examples of Stencila documents with provenance data

# `simple-1.json`

This is a very first go at creating a document with character-level provenance recorded during generation. It has two instructions, one for a simple paragraph, the other for a code chunk. It has human additions and edits to the machine written content. The human author is currently anonymous (uses byte 255 as an author index).
