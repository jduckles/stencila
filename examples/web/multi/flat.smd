# Quotes

Is it <q>be, or not</q>?

> To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them.
> 
> -- William Shakespeare, Hamlet

# Admonitions

A note,

> [!note]
> Just a quick note

> Never mind, everything is OK, don't panic.

# Math

The area of a circle with radius $r$ is:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

# Display code

Can be `inline` or block level,

```python
# FizzBuzz implementation from 1 to 100
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```

# Executable code

Can be inline or `6 * 7`{exec} or block level,

```r exec
# Create histogram of 100 random normal values, no title and light blue bars
hist(rnorm(1000), 
     col = "lightblue",
     main = "",
     xlab = "Value",
     breaks = 30)
```

# Commands

A command that has not been executed,

::: create plot of random numbers :::

A command that has been executed,

::: create paragraph, 50 words or less, on the heisenburg uncertainty principle >>>

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that we cannot simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a quantum particle with arbitrary precision. The more accurately we measure one property, the more uncertain our measurement of the other property becomes.

# If Blocks

::: if 1 > 0

Yeah

::: else 

Nah

:::

# For Blocks

::: for i in [1,2,3]

`i`{exec}

:::

# Styled Blocks

::: style text-xl text-center text-red-400

Red, centred, text

:::

# Sections

::: introduction

An introduction section.
