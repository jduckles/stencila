# Stencila examples

**Mainly for testing.**

## `nodes`

Each of the examples in the `nodes` directory is a Stencila `Article` containing examples of a particular type of document node. The primary purpose for these examples is providing a consistent set of tests fixtures across file formats.

The canonical source for each document is the file with the `.json` extension (e.g. the canonical source for the "paragraph" document is `paragraph/paragraph.json`). Other files, with the same file name stem but different extension (e.g. `paragraph/paragraph.yaml`) are generated by Stencila "codecs" when tests are run (and then subsequently checked for changes), and represent the same document, but in a different format. These alternative files thus represent "snapshots" of how each codec is working. This is really useful for automatically implementing regression testing for each codec.

To add a new example create a new folder and create a `.json` file within it containing examples of the document node you wish to test.

When adding new examples, or updating existing ones, to updated derived files (i.e. non-JSON files) do this,

```console
make examples
```

## `instructions`

The [`instructions`](instructions) folder is for testing the performance of Stencila's AI assistants. Each subfolder has a `document.md` containing an example document, and several YAML files each containing and [`InstructionBlock`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/blob/main/docs/reference/schema/edits/instruction-block.md) or an [`InstructionInline`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/blob/main/docs/reference/schema/edits/instruction-inline.md). During testing, each instruction is executed within the context of the document.
