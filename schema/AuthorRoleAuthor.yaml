description: Union type for things that can be an author in `AuthorRole`.
$comment: |
  This type merely exists to avoid the excessively long type name
  (`PersonOrOrganizationOrSoftwareApplicationOrThing`) that is otherwise generated.
  The `Thing` variant is intended only for anonymous authors which is not known to
  be one the other variants and which should be given the name "anon".
default: Person
anyOf:
  - $ref: Person
  - $ref: Organization
  - $ref: SoftwareApplication
  - $ref: Thing
